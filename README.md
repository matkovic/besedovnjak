# besedovnjak

This is just a simple Java gui program for searching words for game (in Slovenian language) called 'Besedovnjak'. I made this a while ago.

First you choose the dictionary where are all possible words that can appear (dictionary that I used is in 'files' folder). Then you enter the game characters (4x4) and click button Search. If you untick the '4x4 square' check box, you can also search for words in bigger or even rectangular shapes. With 'Min' and 'Max' checkboxes you choose what length of words should program search for.

It is not very efficient because of recursion, but it does its job.
